# API Concepts

This directory is for conceptual proposals for APIs.  Typically this means code that does not yet work, but is demonstrating a desired interface for discussion or proposed implementation.

This is in contrast to use case-driven notebooks, which generally are organized around a science goal rather than to demonstrate a particular API.  For those see other notebook locations.
